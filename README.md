# pythonFundamentals
Learn the fundamentals of Python variable, strings, function, if statement, loops, etc.

# Variables
```
x = 5           # x is equal to "5"
| x = x + 1     # x plus 1 equals?
| print (x)     # What will the print function results be for x?
```

# Strings
```
x = Str         # x is equal to "Str"
y = ings        # y is equal to "ings"
z = x + y       # z is equal to x + y
print (z)       # What will the print function results be for z?
```

# Slice string
```
x = strings     # x is equal to the word "strings"
x = x[2:5]      # Slice between 2 through 5 within variable x
print (x)       # What will the print function results be for x?
```

# Functions
```
def ans(x):     # Definition "ans" is the name of the function
    y = x + 2   # y equals x plus 2
    return y    # The return command outputs the result of y
ans(4)          # Definition ans will use the variable 4; What will the result display?
```

# if statement
```
x = 5           # x is equal to 5
if x + 1 == 6;  # if x + 1 == 6 This will evaluate whether the statement is true or not
    print(x)    # What will the print function result display?
```

# loops
```
for i in range(1,50):   # for i in range between 1 through 50
    if i % 2 == 0;      # Evaluate and extract results of i
        print(i)        # What will the print function result display?
```
